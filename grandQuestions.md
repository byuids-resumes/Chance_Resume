# Project 6
## Elevator Pitch
In this course I have learned three main things. I learned how to create stories from data, to wrangle data, and some basics of machine learning. Creating charts allows me to search for patterns in data that I have access to and to find possible correlations between certain variables. Wrangling data allows me to make use of incomplete data or data that has bad values by fixing the value. Learning about machine learning has helped me to understand what is actually is and the basics about how it functions.
## Grade Requst
This is my first semester doing any real programming in Python and I have learned alot about it in this course. I have learned a lot about using pandas and altair in particular. I can now make basic charts and to help visualize data. I now understand that I can use charts to find hidden relations between variables in the data that I have been asked to look at. I am now able to clean data by making decisions on wether to remove certain information or fix it by creating a good value that can replace the bad one. I am only able to do this because I have gotten descent at navigating through a pandas dataframe and writting code to manipulate one. I have found loc and replace extremely helpful for doing such tasks. I have also become familiar with how to answer my own questions about Pandas and Altair by using stackoverflow or the documentation on them. I am now able to feel my way arround a machine learning model and i expect this to be very useful for next semester when I take the machine learning course. 

I request a B for this course because I am not as confident as I could be with all of these tools but I now have a solid foundation for looking into more data science related topics. I only scored a 2 on the coding challenge but will be retaking it shortly to get atleast a 3.
## Grand Questions:

#### Join the BYUI Data Science Resumes GitHub organization and use the template repository to make a resume repository under your repositories. A good name might be LASTNAME-Resume.
I joined the GitHub organization and created my own repo using the template. The name of the repo is Chance_Resume.
#### Clone your repository to your computer and build a first draft of your resume.
The repo was cloned to my computer using git through the command line. I took a resume that I had already worked hard on and made a few adjustments and then formatted it to look nice in a .md file.
#### Push your results to GitHub and have another student fork your repository to make edits.
Two other students forked my repo and created a generic file that had nothing to do with my resume. I pushed the resume to GitHub after they had already forked.
#### Accept the proposed changes from the student review and finish your final version.
I accepted the changes of one of the students because only one needed to be accepted. The added file is called "G Fork".
#### Make sure your resume is forked by BYU-I Data Science Resumes
I am unsure how to make the organization fork my repo because I do not own it.
My repo is here: https://github.com/chancelopata/Chance_Resume
